What are Decorators?

Decorators in TypeScript are the language-specific feature used to modify and transform the classes 
and their members at the time of their declarations. 
Decorators are the simple functions defined using the @ symbol before their names

Decorators are special TypeScript features that let you add extra behavior to classes, 
methods, properties, or parameters in a clean and reusable way. 
They are used a lot in frameworks like Angular.

Types of Decorators:
Class Decorators - Enhance or modify a class.
Method Decorators - Add functionality to methods.
Property Decorators - Work with class properties.
Parameter Decorators - Work with parameters of a method.
